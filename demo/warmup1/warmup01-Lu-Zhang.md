Part II£ºCooking Recipe--Plush Coconut Cake
-------------------------------------------

### *Ingredients*

-   all-purpose flour
-   baking soda
-   fine sea salt
-   granulated sugar
-   coconut oil
-   low-fat coconut milk
-   plain vinegar

### *Special Kitchen Tools*

-   parchment paper
-   nonstick cooking spray
-   pan
-   oven

### *Steps*

1.  Heat oven to 350 degrees F.
2.  Line the bottom of 9-inch round cake pan with a fitted round of parchment paper and coat the bottoms and sides with nonstick cooking spray.
3.  Whisk together flour, baking soda, salt and granulated sugar in the bottom of a large mixing bowl.
4.  Add coconut oil, coconut milk, and vinegar and whisk until batter is smooth.
5.  Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until the top is springy and a tester inserted in the center comes out batter-free.
6.  Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then cut around it with a knife to ensure it is loosened and flip it out onto a cooling rack to cool the rest of the way.

### *Variations of the recipe*

If you wish to make a glaze: Whisk together 3/4 cup powdered sugar with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the leftover coconut milk, adding a little at a time, until it is smooth but not too runny. Add a pinch of salt, if you wish. Once cake is fully cool, spread over the top of the cake and smooth to the edges with a knife or small offset spatula, where it will find its way down the sides decoratively on its own.

### *Using other ingredients*

Use eggs instead of using coconut oil.

Part III£º Euclidean Distance
-----------------------------

| **Definition**                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment) connecting them $\\mathbf{\\overline{pq}}$. |

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>...,*q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space,then the distance (*d*) from **p** to **q**, or from **p** to **q** is given by the Pythagorean formula:
$$
\\begin{aligned}
d(\\mathbf{p,q})=d(\\mathbf{q,p})&=\\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2+(q\_2-p\_2)^2+...+(q\_n-p\_n)^2}\\\\&=\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n}(q\_i-p\_i)^2}
\\end{aligned}
$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:
$$
\\Vert{\\mathbf{P}}\\Vert=\\sqrt{p\_1^2+p\_2^2+...+p\_n^2}=\\sqrt{\\mathbf{P}\\cdot \\mathbf{P}}
$$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
